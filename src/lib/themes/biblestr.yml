  Search for articles by title, content, or author. Use "author:pubkey" to find articles by a specific author.

  **Bookstr Macro (NKBIP-08):**
  Use `[[book::...]]` to embed Bible passages inline in articles:
  • `[[book::bible | john 3:16]]` - Single verse
  • `[[book::bible | romans 1:16-25]]` - Verse range
  • `[[book::bible | psalms 23:1, 3-5]]` - Multiple verses
  • `[[book::bible | john 3:16 | kjv]]` - With version
  • `[[book::bible | john 3:16 | kjv drb]]` - Multiple versions
  • `[[book::bible | romans 1:16-25, psalms 19:2-3 | kjv]]` - Multiple references with global version
  • `[[book::john 3:16]]` - Without collection (defaults to bible)
  • `[[book::catechism | ccc 1]]` - Catechism paragraph
  • `[[book::catechism | ccc 1-10]]` - Catechism range
  • `[[book::catechism | ccc 1, 3, 5]]` - Multiple paragraphs

  You can also use `book::` prefix (without brackets) in the search bar to search for Bible passages. The macro can be used in wikilinks within article content.
