  Search for articles by d-tag and pubkey/npub.
  • `d-tag1...` - Search for a specific article by its d-tag
  • `d-tag1...*pubkey1...` - Search for a specific article by its d-tag and pubkey/npub
  • `npub1...` - Search for any articles by the author's pubkey/npub

  You can also search using Nostr event and address identifiers:
  • `nevent1...` - Search for a specific event by its nevent identifier
  • `naddr1...` - Search for a specific article by its naddr identifier

  **Bookstr Macro (NKBIP-08):**

  Use `[[book:: collection | book chapter:section | version]]` to embed book passages inline in articles.

  You can also use `book::` prefix (without brackets) in the search bar to search for book passages.

  **Compare content with diff:**

  • diff::article1 | article2
  • diff::article1*pubkey1 | article2*pubkey2 (compare specific authors)
  • diff::[[book::bible | john 3:16 | kjv]] | [[book::bible | john 3:16 | niv]]
